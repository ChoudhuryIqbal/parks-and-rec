# Leagues API

A league is an entity created by a user to manage a single league that is associated to the sport. 

### Required fields

* leagueId (required) is an integer auto-generated by the database, the API requires a valid number be passed to it, but doesn't do anything with it.  I should fix this in a future PR.
* leagueName (required) is a string, keep it under 255 characters
* description (required) is a string, keep it under 255 characters
* sportId (required) is an integer, it is the ID number of the sport this league belongs to.  There is no validation if the sportId exists.
  
### Optional fields

* ageMin is an integer value
* ageMax is an integer value
* coed is a boolean value, 0 or false for not a coed league, and 1 or true for a coed league
* teamMin is an integer value
* teamMax is an integer value
* leagueSchedule is a string, keep it under 255 characters
* leagueRules is a string, keep it under 255 characters
